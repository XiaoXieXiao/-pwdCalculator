## HardPassword:  Creating Unbreakable Passwords

This Python module offers a robust solution for generating secure, complex passwords from simple numerical input. Using a combination of a customizable second-degree function and a layered encoding system, it transforms your number-based password into a truly uncrackable string.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Input:**
   - Provide your numerical password as a list of integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
   - Define your encoding function using a list of coefficients for the second-degree equation (e.g., `[1, 2, 0]` representing x² + 2x).

2. **Encoding:**
   - The module applies the provided function to each digit in your password, generating a new list of encoded numbers.

3. **Transformation:**
   - Each encoded number is then transformed into a character using a specific mapping:
     - Even-numbered positions: Uppercase letters
     - Odd-numbered positions: Lowercase letters
     - Characters for every fourth position
     - The remaining positions: Special characters. 

4. **Output:**
   - The module returns a complex, randomized password string composed of letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from hard_password import HardPassword

# Your numerical password
my_pwd = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 6]

# Your encoding function (x² + 2x)
my_function = [1, 2, 0]

# Instantiate the HardPassword object
new_pwd = HardPassword(my_pwd, my_function)

# Generate the secure password
new_pwd.create_pwd()
```

**Output:**
```
3*Oo8#Hw48 
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Security:**  The combination of encoding and character mapping significantly strengthens password complexity.
- **Customizability:**  You can adjust the encoding function to personalize your password generation process.
- **Ease of Use:**  The module provides a simple interface for generating strong passwords with minimal effort.

**Additional Tips:**

- Combine your generated password with a memorable phrase for further security.
- Store your password securely and avoid reusing it across different platforms.
- Regularly update your password for optimal protection. 

**Remember, strong passwords are crucial for protecting your online information.  This module empowers you to create truly uncrackable passwords with ease!**
